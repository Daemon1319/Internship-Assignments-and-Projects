    <h1>Running: Moving Forward with Purpose</h1>
    <h2>Why I Love Running</h2>
    <p>Running gives me a chance to clear my mind and stay active.
        Whether it's a quick jog around the neighborhood, a long run through the park,
        every run helps me feel healthier and more energized.
        <br><br>
        Beyond staying fit, running has taught me
        that I can accomplish more than I think when I keep pushing forward.

    <p>
        My favorite time to run is always in the afternoon when the sun is setting. <br>
        There's something magical about watching the sky change colors while I move through my route.
